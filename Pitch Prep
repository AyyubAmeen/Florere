Introducing SLIDE 1:
Name, role : project managers, developers


Prototyping SLIDE 7 Ayuub
As a small team we have endeavoured to complete some of our most basic goals creating a simple example of a carbon footprint calculator which also has a point based system which would lead onto the game like design of our app which would help us motivate our users through simpler statistics
We also tried to develop a small part of a chatbot that could be used to be a more friendly way to introduce and help users through steps they might be unsure of
In future we could use AI to scrape the internet for data relating to climate change to create our own metrics and information
We could also automate the adding of events to an event screen to provide users with an ever evolving list of events to join


Research SLIDE 4
We went and looked for other apps that accomplished some of the self same goals we are heading for
Most of them were just made for one function and because of this not many used them which showed us there was a gap in the market
We then decided to conduct a survey to gather better opinions on prospective users' thoughts on it.
Improvise off of slide info
From all this we can firmly see that there is would be wide appeal for an application like ours and further strengthens our idea

Why are we doing this? SLIDE 2
As we grow as a society what we require to survive increases making the maintenance of our planet a second thought
This has lead to us destroying it due to our complacency and contentment
Our solution encapsulates all other problems bc if we don’t combat climate change then we’d have much larger and more fundamental challenges to deal with in the future as it could cripple our planet and put us all in worst place overall
Natural disasters would become way more common and we’d be having to worry about our own survival a lot more which is why it is imperative we address this right now

Making an universal app for climate conscious users to use as a hub for all their environmental action needs SLIDE 3,6
Monitoring and calculating the users carbon footprint
Comparing them to others in their area and providing more area specific statistics to encourage them and their community to be advocates for climate change. (eg. how many greenspaces there are, energy conscious providers etc)
Can provide information on events and rallies pertaining to climate change to help users make a stand for climate action from businesses and governments.
Can document food based on how seasonal it is to reduce food miles and to reduce food waste by suggesting different things to eat.
Can provide proven and scientifically sound data and documentation on climate change all in one place to reduce the effect of misinformation
Can also use that data to compare to all the metrics you have logged into the app and give educated suggestions on how to change these.
Can collate events for our users to join that they may have not known of before
Is able to provide a forum like space for users to access to chat, collaborate and grow closer as a community with, while also providing a space for climate change event organisation starting climate action rallies
